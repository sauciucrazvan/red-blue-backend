# The RED & BLUE Game

**RED & BLUE** is a real-time multiplayer competitive game application, where two players compete simultaneously. The goal is to provide a fast-paced, interactive, and balanced experience. Users connect, choose a color (red or blue), and the backend manages the game flow via Websockets.

The mechanics involve move selections, scoring, an animated timer, and a notification system. The project was developed to strengthen teamwork, asynchronous programming, and modern UI design.

The game is publicly hosted at: https://redblue.razvansauciuc.dev/

## The Origin

The project started with our internship at [ASSIST Software](https://assist-software.net/).

We've met their requirements and even added features ourselves. It was supposed to be a team project built that teached us different concepts related to front-end & back-end.

Things we learned while working on the project (only the back-end team):

- what is a REST API and how to implement it
- how to work with Websockets, an ORM
- improved our usage of Git
- how to properly structure a back-end application
- how to deploy a back-end application
