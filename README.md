# The RED & BLUE Game

**RED & BLUE** is a fast-paced head-to-head sabotaging game. Be the only one with a positive score to win.

The game is publicly hosted at: https://redblue.razvansauciuc.dev/

## The Origin

The project started with our internship at [ASSIST Software](https://assist-software.net/).

We've met their requirements and even added features ourselves. It was supposed to be a team project built that teached us different concepts related to front-end & back-end.

Things we learned while working on the project (only the back-end team):

- what is a REST API and how to implement it
- how to work with Websockets, an ORM
- improved our usage of Git
- how to properly structure a back-end application
- how to deploy a back-end application
